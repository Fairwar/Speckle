This directory holds all of the required executables and data files for running SPEC.

Compiling the binaries is done "in vivo", calling into the actual SPEC CPU2006
directory. Once completed, the binaries are copied into this directory. 

The reasoning is that compiling the benchmarks is complicated and difficult (so
why rebuild it), but we want better control over executing the binaries.  Of
course, we are forgoing the validation and results building infrastructure of
SPEC. 

To compile binaries:

   - set the $SPEC_DIR in gen_binaries.sh
   - modify riscv.cfg in $SPEC_DIR/configs as desired
   - run gen_binaries.sh
